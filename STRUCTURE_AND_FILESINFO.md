### Explanation of the Structure:

---

#### `e-giftcard-portal/`
- **Project root directory**: This is the root directory of your project where all main files and folders reside.

---

#### `static/`**:
   - **`css/`**: Contains static CSS files used throughout the app.

#### `main/`
- **App directory**: This folder contains all the components related to your `main` Django application, such as views, URLs, templates, and migrations.

1. **`templates/`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains all HTML templates that are rendered by the views in the app.
   - **`main/` folder**: Stores templates related to this app.
     - **`base.html`**: This is the base template that contains the common layout (header, footer, styles) for the entire application. It is extended by other HTML templates.
     - **`home.html`**: The main landing page for the site, which extends `base.html` and contains the specific content for the homepage.
     - **`login-register.html`**: The template used for both the login and registration pages. The form and content are dynamically rendered based on the URL path.

2. **`__init__.py`**:
   - Marks this directory as a Python package. It is required for the app to be recognized by Python and Django.

3. **`admin.py`**:
   - Contains the code to register models with the Django admin interface.

4. **`apps.py`**:
   - Contains the configuration for the app. This file is auto-generated when creating the app.

5. **`models.py`**:
   - Defines the database models for the app. These models correspond to the tables that will be created in the database.

6. **`views.py`**:
   - Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and responses. It renders templates, interacts with models, and processes the requests for different endpoints.

7. **`urls.py`**:
   - Defines the URL routing for the app. Each URL pattern is mapped to a view, which then renders the associated template or returns a response.

#### `manage.py`
- **Django management script**: The main script used to manage the project, run development servers, perform migrations, and more.

---

#### `requirements.txt`
- **List of dependencies**: This file contains the list of Python packages required to run the project. When a new developer sets up the project, they can install these dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

#### `giftcard_portal/`
- **Main project directory**: This folder contains the settings and configuration files for the entire project.

1. **`__init__.py`**:
   - Marks this directory as a Python package.

2. **`settings.py`**:
   - **Purpose**: Contains the project settings, including installed apps, middleware, database settings, static and media configurations, etc.

3. **`urls.py`**:
   - **Purpose**: The root URL configuration file, which maps URLs to views. It includes the URL configurations for all installed apps (e.g., `main.urls`).

4. **`wsgi.py`**:
   - **Purpose**: This file is used to serve the project in a production environment using WSGI-compatible servers.

### **Summary of Key Templates and Their Purpose**:

1. **`base.html`**:
   - The layout template for the entire application. Contains the header and footer that are reused across different pages.

2. **`home.html`**:
   - The landing page of the website, containing information about the site and links to other parts of the application.

3. **`login-register.html`**:
   - A template that serves both the login and registration forms, depending on the dynamic URL path and the view logic.
